## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Karim, curious person in solving problems via computational techniques. I am building experience in quantum computing simulations and enjoying it so far! moreover, I enjoy leveraging data in football analytics.

## Quantum Computing
I work on open projects in quantum computing simulations, such as being an active participant in quantum computing challenges:
- in 2023: I participated together with an awesome team in the "Deloitte's Quantum Climate Challenge 2023" and won the 3rd position
[view my Deloitte Quantum Computing Certificate](https://github.com/KarimElgammal/certificates/blob/e7d758d939eee008220b4414217650bc7f0b860a/Quantum%20Computing/DELOITTE_CERTIFICATE_Karim%20Elgammal.pdf)

- in 2024: I participate with two colleagues to form a team called 'inhibitQ', where we are in the 2nd phase of the challenge at the moment and among 3 shortlisted teams in a challenge concerned with quantum mobility with a usecase in solid-state for corrosion inhibition.

## Atomistic Simulations
Currently, I am working as atomistic simulation engineer who leverages DFT to solve industry problems, with help of data modeling! For the job to be done, I need to use variety of codes such as:
- Quantum espresso, PySCF, Psi4 ...etc
- Machine learning potentials such as matGL, M3GNet, CHGNet
- Leverage data and use machine learning libraries such as XGBoost
- Leverage HPC resources and build small HPC clusters using AWS ParallelCluster
- Leverage accelerated computing through NVidia's NGC docker images and AWS AMI's
